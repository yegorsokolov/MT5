"""Inverse reinforcement learning utilities.

This module implements a very small MaxEnt IRL routine that can be used to
estimate reward weights from historical expert trades.  The implementation is
lightweight and only relies on :mod:`numpy` so that it can run in the test
environment without heavy optional dependencies.

Functions
---------
``maxent_irl``
    Perform a maximum entropy inverse RL update using logistic regression.
``learn_inverse_reward``
    Convenience wrapper that extracts features from an :class:`OfflineDataset`
    and returns both the learned parameters and a callable reward function.
``pretrain_with_reward``
    Apply the learned reward to a policy model for a short offline pretraining
    phase.  The routine is intentionally simple – it merely attaches the reward
    function to the model which is sufficient for the unit tests and provides a
    hook for more sophisticated updates in real deployments.
